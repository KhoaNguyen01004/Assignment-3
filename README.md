# CMSC204 Assignment #3

### Assignment Description
Your assignment is to write a generic double singly-linked list class with an iterator, and a generic sorted double singly-linked list class with an iterator that 
inherits from your generic double singly-linked list class. The GUI has been provided for you for this assignment to help you visualize your linked list. Your list classes 
will also be tested with Junit tests. Upload the initial files from Blackboard and your working files in a directory into the repository in GitHub you created in Lab 1 and take 
a screen shot of the files.
